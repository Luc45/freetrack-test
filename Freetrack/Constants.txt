S_WARNING_MODEL_3P_PITCH = Tracking is unreliable when the point plane is close to being parallel with camera plane (when pitching down).\nAvoid by ensuring middle point is deeper than it is high.
S_WARNING_MODEL_3P_YAW = Tracking is unreliable when a forward point moves behind the middle point (when yawing).\nAvoid by keeping depth greater than width.

S_HINT_THRESHOLD = Adjust this and camera exposure to completely isolate the tracking points.\nWide angle infrared LEDs and visible light filter recommended.\nFor best results remove webcam infrared filter.
S_HINT_AVERAGE =  Point locations averaged across this many camera frames.\nIncreases stability at the expense of responsiveness.
S_HINT_SENSITIVITY = Multiplies real measurements. Equals real head measurements when set to one and response curve axis limit set to maximum. 
S_HINT_SMOOTHING = Increases stability and smoothness with some loss of low to mid-speed responsiveness.\nHigh speed responsiveness not affected as much. Additional smoothing applied by games\nneeds to be taken into consideration.

S_HINT_DYNAMICSMOOTHING = Reduce smoothing during motion to improve responsiveness while maintaining stability.\nTracking generally less smooth but depends on amount of in-game smoothing.
S_HINT_AUTOLOADPROFILE = When TrackIR or FreeTrack enabled program is launched, its associated profile is loaded.\nAny profile changes are discarded unless option to auto-save profile is checked.
