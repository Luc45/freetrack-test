
FreeTrack Version History
=========================

* 2.2.0.0
---------- 
.: RGB filter resolution and sensitivity improved. 
.: Force Exposure integrated into camera properties, all slider and checkbox states are automatically remembered. 
.: Smoothing and averaging made indepedent of frame rate. 
.: Maintaining paused data is optional so that view can be changed by other means. 
.: Tracked points are highlighted for better visibility.
.: Comprehensive software documentation. 
.: Dialog displayed when new TrackIR program detected for name entry. 
.: TrackIR, SmartNav and OptiTrack cameras supported. Need to install OptiTrack SDK.
.: Center of rotation calibration improved, simplified and extended to all 6dof tracking modes. 
.: Camera calibration available for calibrating all distances to millimeters. 
.: Profile extension changed from *.fgp (FreeTrack Game Profile) changed to *.ftp (FreeTrack Profile).
.: Controls now have default mapping. 
.: Axis mapping, primarily for allowing head mounted cameras (x and y swapped with yaw and pitch). 
.: Camera orientation can be accounted for so that translation directions are correct.  
.: 3D preview options (in right click menu) for displaying render frame rate and pose data frame rate. 
.: Fixed: TrackIR enabled games freezing on launch for some people (even when FreeTrack is not running). 
.: Four point cap sensitivities increased to match three point cap and clip.
.: Open source FreeTrack interface available for 3rd party apps. See SDK directory. 
.: Point size max/min diameter control. 
.: Jitter changed to measure number of frames that deviate by more than 40 percent instead of 15 percent. 
.: Fixed: Point tracking not covering entire video for resolutions 640x480 and higher. 
.: Fixed: NAN axis-lock. A 3 point cap model that produced NAN errors is still degenerate though.
.: Fixed: 4 point cap custom model dimensions initialization. 
.: Option to ignore backward Z movement, mainly to avoid virtual head passing through vehicle seat.  
.: Video codec support should now include; YVU9, IF09, YV12, YV16, IYUV, I420, NV12, IMC1, IMC2, IMC3, IMC4, Y800, RGB8, Y8, GREY, YUYV, YUY2, YVYU, UYVY, Y422, RGB24, ARGB32 and RGB32.
.: USB Video Class (UVC) standard now supported (YUYV) (eg driverless webcam). 
.: Wii remote camera auto-orientation using accelerometer data.
.: Added support for Wii remote camera, practically no cpu usage and more than triple normal webcam frame rate, tested with BlueSoleil. 
.: Greyed disabled options in Camera Properties can be enabled just by clicking on them (auto-exposure workaround). 
.: Extra game support if TIRViews.dll is available (comes with TrackIR software). Notably full 6DOF in FS2004. 
.: Translation can be made with respect to current view, using optional yaw, pitch and roll and affecting optional x, y and z axes.
.: Fixed: RGB mode crashing with too much light. 
.: 3D preview fps no longer limited to webcam fps, uses interpolated data, better representation of tracking quality.  
.: Custom center; define your own default center location and orientation.
.: Grand Prix Legends TIR detection work-around. 
.: Significant improvement to tracking responsiveness and accuracy by using weighted mean to find point centers instead of bounding box. Less smoothing required. 
.: Control input now possible via mouse and joystick buttons and extended keyboard keys recognised. 
.: Auto-select correct language on first run if translation available.
.: Multi-language support using DKLang. New translations must be made using DKLang Translation Editor, see Language directory for details. 
.: Fixed: ArmA rapid view shaking due to short data timeout. 

* 2.1.0.0
----------
.: FS2004/2002 4dof support (requires FSUIPC.dll 3.xx in Modules directory)
.: Video demonstration mode.
.: Keyboard output.
.: Absolute mouse control, better accuracy for desktop use.
.: Pixel doubling
.: Improved responsiveness
.: Filter can be manually changed via ini file (auto, mmx, sse2).
.: 3D scene destroyed on minimization to improve compatibility.  
.: Preset response curves available through right-click popup and ability to copy curves to other axes. 
.: Response curves no longer cause centering lag. 
.: Enlarged response curves from 160 to 180 degrees. 
.: Output page added to GUI, mouse options for axis source, mousewheel and autopan, PPJoy controller number can now be selected. 
.: Dynamic smoothing control, reduces when head moves, and increases when head is stationary. 
.: Center hotkey works while paused. 
.: Middle mouse center option.
.: Double-tap to change hotkey toggle mode.
.: Hotkey page added to GUI, stored in profile, axis and output have on/off hotkeys, smoothing can be modified via hotkey.
.: FSX support through SimConnect.
.: Launch at startup, start minimized, confirm close and auto-minimize options.  
.: Video resolution remembered.
.: Force camera exposure control dialog, ensures new video streams have desired exposure. 
.: Auto select correct filter for user's cpu if .ax file is missing.
.: RGB24 3 point tracking fixed. 
.: 3 point cap tracking mode. 
.: New interpolation timer with control of the number of additional frames. 
.: Auto-load profile on detection of specified 6dof capable game, optional. 
.: New profile manager, drag and drop games to associate them with a profile for autoloading. 
.: Better synchronization of interpolation with webcam.
.: 'Floating deadzone' renamed to 'smoothing' to reduce ambiguity.
